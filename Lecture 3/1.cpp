There is a circular jail with 100 cells numbered 1 -
100. Each cell has an inmate and the door is  locked.
One night the jailor gets drunk and starts  running around the
jail in circles.
In his first round he  opens each door.
In his second round he visits  every 2nd door (2, 4, 6-- -) and
shuts the door.
In the  3rd round he visits every 3rd door (3, 6, 9-- -) and
if  the door is shut he
opens it, if it is open he shuts it.
	This continues for 100 rounds (i.e. 4, 8, 12 -- -; 5, 10, 15 -- -; -- -;
		                               49, 98 etc.)
			and exhausted the jailor falls down.
			How many prisoners found their doors open  after 100 rounds ?
